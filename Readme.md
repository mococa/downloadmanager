### What is it?
It's a "multi-thread" download manager. So you can keep your list of programs always updated and when you want to download them whenever something happens (e.g a sudden need to wipe your PC data), your programs will be there, at least.

### Why?
Why not, it's simple but pretty useful.

### Benefits
  - It's all in one.
  - You can choose to to open the downloaded file right after it's done or not.
  - You don't have to wait for one to finish to start another. You can download them all at the same time if you want.
  - You get notified when one finishes downloading (UI (The button turns green) and a MessageBox alert).
  - Don't want your files to be downloaded into your C drive? Just drag the .exe file to another drive and it'll automaticallly create a folder and set it as the new download folder.
  - It's lightweight (.exe around 30mb).
  - Already comes with most used coding programs.
  - It's open-source.

# Usage
